        <h4>Mother's Day Strawberry Cake</h4>

        <p>This cake will always have a special place in my heart. I make if for my mom every mothers day. It is a simple white cake with strawberries baked into it. It can be difficult to keep this cake from becoming dry but I think I manage. It also gets baked in a pie dish, not a cake pan. I typically serve a slice with whipped cream or nutella. I really like the combination of the not super sweet cake and the slightly sour strawberries with the whipped cream. Definitely a good cake if you are looking for a cake with fruit and no frosting.</p>

        <h4>There Was an Attempt Strawberry Shortcake</h4>

        <p>This cake was... <i>an experience</i> to say the least. I made this cake with my friends and we really tried our best. It was definitely fun to bake a cake with my friends but the result was not stellar. I wish I could say it looks ugly but tastes good, but it did not taste good. We used the wrong sugar and I think we over whipped the whipped cream. The cake itself was really dry and the whipped cream did not help make it less dry. The strawberries on top were the best part. I probably would not make this again but if I did I would certainly make some changes, including not letting my friends into the kitchen to help.</p>

        <h4>Vegan Chocolate Cake</h4>

        <p>This cake was for a friend of a friends birthday. I had never made a vegan cake before but it was fun to see what items were swapped with what. The cake itself was pretty good, but I feel like you could tell it was not a normal cake. We also had to transport the cake to the party, but the frosting was slippery, so the top layer slid all over inside the cake dome, so the cake was not very pretty by the time it was eaten. Regardless, the birthday girl appreciated the cake and everyone said it was pretty good.</p>

        <p>This cake was baked for extra credit in my french class. In french it is called a Bûche de Noël (aka a Yule Log cake). I baked it with my two friends in my french class and we made a video of ourselves making it while speaking french to turn in for extra credit. This was one of the best cakes I had ever made. It was beautiful to look at, the frosting complemented the cake perfectly, and the cake itself was even and moist. This cake defintely takes longer and has more steps to make it, but in my opinion it is <b>totally worth it.</b></p>

        <h4>Halloween Special</h4>

        <p>This cake was a special cake for my friends and I's halloween party. It was really fun to make and decorate it. The cake itself was just a simple box mix red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. Then we made homemade fondant to decorate our cake. It was a very sticky process involving a lot of marshmellows. We covered the cake in a layer of grey dyed fondant. Then we made a big rice krispie treat and shaped it into a big cleaver. We covered the handle with dark grey and the blade part with light grey. Then we put the fondany covered knife on top of the cake. We added red decoration frosting to add the spookiness of our cake. For the final touch, I put red food dye on my fingers and added some "bloody fingerprints" to the cake. Not the most delicious cake I have made, but probably the most fun looking one.</p>
