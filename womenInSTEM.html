        <h2>Women and Girls in STEM</h2>

         <h3>My Experience as a Woman in STEM</h3>
         <article>
            <p>I have been interested in STEM since I was young, with both of my engineer parents always encouraging me. However, I know that my experiences can be rare, as many girls' parents discourage them from STEM. As a young girl interested in STEM many teachers encouraged me. But I noticed as I grew older the encouragement slowly faded away. I was already very invested in STEM and knew I wanted to major in Computer Science, so I personally did not need the encouragement anymore, but I know plenty of girls do need the continued encouragement. I persevered with my parents always encouraging me. I joined my high school's robotics team and wound up become one of the youngest captains on the team. I was often underestimated both because of my age and my gender. People often thought that I was a diversity pick for captain, which I believed I proved was false. Throughout my time in robotics, I watched boys take tools out of the girls' hands, ignore or not communicate with them, or brush off their ideas. It was very frustrating to see. As a captain, I advocated for the girls on the team and often checked in with them. I encouraged the guys to use their words rather than taking over a project. But I know there is a lot more work with sexism in STEM than one high schooler can handle. I was also the only girl in my engineering class in high school. That fact made me insecure and caused my grade to drop because I felt so alone in the class. We need to put girls in classes with other girls so that they have a companion to work with and ask if they do not understand something. In college, just like in elementary school, women are still avoided when it comes to group projects. There is a lot of work to be done in the area of sexism in STEM.</p>

         <h3>My Research Project</h3>
         <article>
            <p>As a senior in high school, I chose to do a senior capstone project on Women and STEM in Education and Workplaces with a focus on figuring out how my district could do better regarding encouraging girls who express interest in STEM. I broke my research up into 7 parts, why inclusion in STEM industries and education is important, the treatment of women in STEM industries, the treatment of women in STEM higher education, identifying deterrents from STEM that affect girls, how to actively dispel deterrents and encourage girls to pursue STEM interests, what my high school's students had to say about its STEM classes and programs, and what my high school specifically could be doing for women in STEM. I spent my last two weeks of high school researching and compiling my research into a presentation and a paper. This project took around 50 hours. I presented my findings during our school's capstone fair where I spoke with many prominent figures in our schools administration, teachers, and students. I also emailed a video of me giving my presentation to al of the STEM teachers in the district. I recieved lots of positive feedback for my hard work. I have embedded the presentation I made as well as a link to a pdf of the paper I wrote summarizing my findings.</p>
