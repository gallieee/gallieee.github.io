          <p>This was the first slice of cake I had on campus. It was from Liz's Market and I was absolutely wowed at how good it was for the price. For the entire first few weeks I kept talking about "2 Dollar Cake" from Liz's Market. I had low expectations for the cake. But it was actually not dry, and the frosting was not overpowering. A very pleasant surprise for my first slice of cake on campus. This was the slice of cake that started my cake review journey.</p>

        <h3>Banana Cake?</h3>

        <article class="articleRight">
          <p>This slice of cake is <b>legendary.</b> The menu that day said it was supposed to be a banana cake but it definitely was not. I have no idea what this cake is actually called. Initially the joke was that it was rock cake because the frosting looks kind of like the texture and color of a rock. But if rocks tasted like this cake, I would eat a whole lot more rocks. This cake was moist, the flavor of the cake was an very pleasant vanilla with oreo peppered throughout. The frosting itself was very sweet but the oreos in the frosting helped balance it out. Whatever this mystery cake was, it was my favorite slice of campus cake.</p>

        <h3>Chocolate Cake #2</h3>

        <article class="articleRight">
          <p>This chocolate cake had less wow factor than the first slice, but it was still good. It was chocolate cake. The frosting on this slice was better than the first but the first slice of cake will always be more memorable. The cake itself was also drier. A good slice of chocolate cake if you are craving chocolate cake, but do not have high expectations.</p>

        <h3>Special Feature: Oreo Pie</h3>

        <article class="articleRight">
          <p>I know this is not a cake but in case you haven't already figured it out, I <i>really</i> like chocolate and oreo desserts. This slice of oreo pie was delicious. Most of the dessert pies they have in the dining hall are good, since pies don't dry out the way that cake does. I must throw in a pie appreciation review. I am more of a cake person but I do appreciate a good slice of pie. I highly recommend the oreo pie and the french silk pie.</p>

        <h3>Honorable Mentions: Brownie Bites & Brookie Bites</h3>
        <article class="articleLeft">

        <article class="articleRight">
         <p>Not a cake or a pie person? These brownie bites made me go back for seconds and I took the all you can eat seriously with these brookie bites. The brownie bites are just the right amount of chocolatey and they have chocolate chunks on top. They are everything you expect a brownie to be. The brookies are the same, although I will say I think the cookie part overwhelmed the brownie part. I love brookies though so my judgement is biased. Regardless if you are looking for a dessert on campus from the dining halls, go for these brownie bites or brookie bites, you will not be dissapointed.</p>
