        <h4>My Coding Journey</h4>
        <article>
        <p>When people ask me: "So how did you pick your major?" I always have to look them in the eye and tell them that in 4th grade I made a choice and it has stuck with me since. In 4th grade we did the day of code event put on by code.org. I immediately fell in love with the little video games where you moved the characters and solved puzzles. From that moment I knew that I wanted to do Computer Science. I rarely wavered in my decision. That is a lie. Everyone questions their choices every once in a while, especially girls with STEM interests. In middle school I joined Technovation at my school, where we formed groups and developed apps using MIT App Inventor. I hated it. So much. I couldn't even participate in coding the app. Why? Block coding filled me with rage. However, I knew and acknowledged that I did not hate coding, I hated the limitations MIT App Inventor had and block coding in general. I quit the club and continued learning code on my own. In high school, I was too afraid of the coding team on the robotics team so I got involved in other areas instead. This did not put a damper on my spirits. I took two coding classes in high school and knew that I still wanted to do Computer Science. The last time I waivered was when my parents made me decide between Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. To be honest, I never really liked engineering and physics. But both my parents were Mechanical Engineers so I felt the pressure. I am so glad that I did not give in though. I am really enjoying Computer Science in college.</p>

        <h4>Where I Am At</h4>
        <article>
        <p>Now, I am planning on declaring my major in Computer Science next semester. I still love coding and Computer Science and I have never liked my classes more. I am also planning on learning a few game engine languages on the side of my class work, which is very exciting for me. I know that I have a lot of room to grow but I am excited for the future.</p>

        <h4>Where I Hope to Be in the Future</h4>
        <article>
        My dream job is working on EndeavorRX or just with Akili Interactive in general. I love their work and their research. But in general, I want to keep being able to both code and be creative. I am hoping to go into either Video Game Design or Web Design. I don't know where my path will lead me, but I am exicted to keep learning and growing.
