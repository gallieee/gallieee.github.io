            <h2>My Experiences with Video Games</h2>
            <article>
               <p>I have loved video games since I was young. Starting out with playing Nintendo games with my older brother to playing FPS games with my high school friends, my love of video games only grew. I play video games of all sorts of genres as a way to relieve stress. However, even in my AP Psych class I was told about the connection between video games and violence, depression, anxiety, and many other negative effects. Video games had never made me feel any of these things, in fact I felt they had the opposite effect on me. This led me to choosing to write my final research paper in 11th grade on the positive effects of video games.</p>

            <h2>My Research Papers on Video Games and Health</h2>
            <article>
               <p>I have written two research papers on the topic of video games and health. The first one was for a final project. Society, The Human Brain, and Video Games is an expansive paper discussing the topics of where the anti-video game stigma came from, positive cognitive effects of video games, and refuting the idea that video games cause violence. I really fell in love with the topic of cognition and video games after writing this paper. It wound up being 13 pages long because I kept going further and further down the rabbit hole. The next time I was asked to write a research paper, I chose to write it on specific positive applications of video games that lead to increased health. The Power of Video Games in a Healthcare Setting was written for my college prepatory writing class. It focuses on specific video games that have been developed and researched that improve people's lives. From VR distracting burn patients, treating ADHD in kids through a racing game, or helping those with mobility issues increase their mobility using Wii or Xbox Kinect. This paper furthered my love of video games and health. Both of these papers are attatched below if you would like to read them.</p>
