            <p>Hi, I’m Allie. I’m an Information Science student on the User Experience Design track at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My primary focus is user-centered and data-driven design and organization, with strengths in UX research and prototyping. As a former Computer Science student, I have a strong technical background that gives me a unique perspective on design. I am also pursuing Computer Science, Game Design, and Digital Studies certificates to support my diverse interests. Outside of classes and work, I’m a board member of UW-Madison’s Game Design and Development Club. I also helped create a game on Steam that has sold hundreds of copies titled Garage Sale.</p>
