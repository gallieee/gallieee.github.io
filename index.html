        <main>
        	<p>Hi! My name is Allie Carlson and I am a student at UW Madison studying <a href="coding.html">Computer Science</a>. I also am a <a href="cakeReview.html">cake connoisseur</a> with a passion for encouraging <a href="womenInSTEM.html">women and girls in STEM</a>. In my free time, I like to <a href="baking.html">bake</a> as well as <a href="videoGames.html">play and create video games</a>. In high school I was a captain of <a href="https://team3082.com/"> the robotics team</a>. Our team won a regional competition and went to the worlds level of play. Now, I am involved with UW Madison's Game Development Club and am working as both a writer and a programmer on a project called garage sale. I also enjoy conducting <a href="videoGames.html">research on video games</a> and <a href="womenInSTEM.html">women in STEM</a>.</p>
